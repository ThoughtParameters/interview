# **Gemini Project Context: InterviewPrep.AI Website**

This document outlines the context, philosophy, and structure for the InterviewPrep.AI website, a professional, multi-page educational platform for technology interview preparation.

## **1\. Project Philosophy**

The core philosophy is to separate content generation from presentation. We will leverage Gemini's deep research capabilities to create comprehensive, expert-level content on various technical subjects. This content will be stored in a structured format and used as the source of truth for generating the user-facing HTML pages. The website will maintain a consistent, clean, "Google-style" theme across all pages to ensure a seamless user experience.

## **2\. Directory Structure**

The project is organized into a scalable structure to accommodate new learning topics and exams over time.

* / (Root Directory)
  * index.html: The main landing/directory page.
  * robots.txt: Instructs search engine crawlers which pages or files the crawler can or can't request from the site.
  * sitemap.xml: Helps search engines better crawl the site by listing all essential pages.
  * GEMINI.md: **This file.** The central context document for the Gemini CLI.
* /learning/
  * index.html: The main "Learning Center" hub. This page will list all available learning topics and link to them.
  * kubernetes.html: A detailed learning page for Kubernetes, generated from the content file.
  * *(Future pages like docker.html, ansible.html will be added here.)*
* /exams/
  * index.html: The main "Exam Hub." This page will list all available practice exams and link to them.
  * kubernetes.html: The interactive practice exam page for Kubernetes.
  * results.html: A generic results page template that will be dynamically populated based on exam performance.
* /assets/
  * /css/style.css: The single, central stylesheet defining the theme for the entire website.
  * /js/main.js: Site-wide JavaScript for elements like navigation and theme toggles.
  * /js/exam-engine.js: The core JavaScript logic for exam functionality (rendering questions, tracking progress, grading).
  * /images/logo.png: Placeholder for a logo (approx. 300x150 pixels).
* /content/
  * **Purpose:** This directory holds the raw, Gemini-generated markdown files that serve as the source of truth for all learning and exam content.
  * **Naming Convention:** \<topic\>\_deep\_dive.md
  * kubernetes\_deep\_dive.md: The comprehensive research document on Kubernetes.
  * *(Future content like docker\_deep\_dive.md will be added here.)*

## **3\. Content Generation Workflow**

The process for adding or updating a topic is as follows:

1. **Research & Generate:** Use Gemini to perform deep research on a subject (e.g., "Docker for Senior DevOps") and generate a comprehensive markdown file (docker\_deep\_dive.md). This file should contain detailed explanations, Q\&A, code examples, and best practices.
2. **Store Content:** Place the generated markdown file into the /content/ directory.
3. **Build Web Pages:** Use the Gemini CLI to generate or update the corresponding web pages. The CLI should be provided with the full context of the website files (especially style.css and the relevant content file from /content/).
   * **Example Prompt:** "Using the content from /content/docker\_deep\_dive.md, create a new learning page at /learning/docker.html and a new exam page at /exams/docker.html, following the structure and style of the existing Kubernetes pages."

## **4\. SEO Strategy**

The website will be optimized for search engines by:

* **Semantic HTML:** Using correct HTML5 tags (\<header\>, \<nav\>, \<main\>, \<section\>, \<article\>) to structure content.
* **Meta Tags:** Including relevant \<title\> and \<meta name="description"\> tags on each page, with keywords derived from the page's content.
* **sitemap.xml:** Maintaining an up-to-date sitemap to ensure all pages are discoverable.
* **robots.txt:** Guiding search engine crawlers effectively.
* **Content is King:** The primary SEO strategy is the high-quality, in-depth content generated by Gemini, which will naturally attract organic traffic.

## **5\. Instructions for Gemini CLI**

When refining or adding features to this website, please adhere to the following:

1. **Full Context is Key:** For any update, provide the full context of all relevant files. For a new topic, this includes style.css, the new content file (e.g., docker\_deep\_dive.md), and an existing example page (e.g., learning/kubernetes.html) for structure.
2. **Maintain the Theme:** All new pages or components must adhere to the established theme in /assets/css/style.css.
3. **Source of Truth:** All informational content on learning and exam pages must be derived directly from the corresponding file in the /content/ directory.
4. **Best Practices:**
   * **HTML:** Use semantic HTML5.
   * **CSS:** Keep the CSS modular. Use CSS variables for theme colors and fonts.
   * **JavaScript:** Write clean, readable, and well-commented code. Separate generic logic (exam-engine.js) from site-wide logic (main.js).
5. **Responsiveness:** All pages must be fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.%
